                            [chref=70]My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.[/chref]<br>
<br>
It is obvious to me now that 'it is very easy' if I <i>care</i>. The more I care, the easier it is. But, what determines how much, and about what, I care? The answer may lie in my basic animal instincts of need and fear. Need drives me forward, but it doesn't prod me to care, as far as I can tell. So, does fear induce me to care?<br>
<br>
Certainly, <i>the fear of losing something 'vital'</i> causes me to care. The more I realize what I am missing in <i>this moment</i>, the more I tend to care about it. Because I care, I'm present 'now'. When fear wanes, care wanes; I leave 'now' and drift away on the wings of [chref=46]many desires[/chref]. <i>So, it is not so much desire, but a lack of fear that leads me astray</i>, i.e., the lack of fear allows desire to get out of hand.<br>
<br>
[chref=53]Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, <b><i>fear</i></b> only paths that lead astray. The great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.[/chref] So there we have it. As the years pass, I know more and more deeply that I am 'possessed of the least knowledge'. So why do we <i>prefer by-paths</i>? Ignorance! [chref=71]'Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty'[/chref] sums it up nicely.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: Interestingly, the guidance value of fear parallels the Christian's 'fear of God'. As the Gospel of Matthew puts it: &quot;And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.&quot; I suppose for me, 'the soul' equals 'now'. And the only one able to 'kill' that is me. All I need do each moment is [chref=64]be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no ruined enterprises.[/chref] I find that <i>everything else </i>takes care of itself! It is easy!                        </div>

<u><b>The short reply:</b></u><br>
<i>Caring</i> <b>without</b> thought to future or past abolishes attachment. Attachment plays itself out in our illusion of time - future and past - and the 'life' we live in that fantasy world. <i>Care</i> felt 'now' is eternal.<br>
<br>
<u><b>The long reply:</b></u><br>
Words are funny little critters. So, I looked up <b><i>care</i></b> and I'll list its synonyms below. This situation is reflected in  Buddha's Fourth Truth, &quot;<a href="http://www.centertao.org/buddha.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">let you sole desire be the performance of your duty</a>&quot;, or similarly,... [chref=15]He who holds fast to this way desires not to be full,[/chref] and,...  [chref=64]Therefore the sage desires not to desire[/chref]. <i>Desire</i>? But desire &quot;results in attachment&quot;, and attachment causes us sorrow. Why do such [chref=78]straightforward words seem paradoxical[/chref]?<br>
<br>
Caring and desire are like a double edged sword. Too much and/or directed in the 'wrong' direction increases suffering. But, an optimal amount directed in a direction 'just right' may decrease suffering. The 'middle path' as Buddha called it. So, on one hand, [chref=46]there is no crime greater than having too many desires[/chref]. On the other hand, one must desire self integrity enough to care enough to ponder consequences; otherwise history will repeat itself.<br>
<br>
In short, I see this as simply the will to survive actually panning out the way nature intended.  Civilization has made that problematic for us. We need to <i>care enough</i> about this if we wish to [chref=71]be alive to [this] difficulty [and] avoid it.[/chref] The problem is not that we care, but that our care is scattered all over the place, conflicting desires, wanting to have it both ways. Care is what drives the squirrel to search for nuts, the tree to grow toward the sun, the bees to find nectar. We, on the other hand, scatter our care in a thousand different directions between a thousand different cares. When we realize what we truly care about and follow that [chref=14]thread[/chref], we can become one with nature.<br>
<br>
<b>The synonyms:</b><br>
aid; attention; care about; caution; concern; fear ([chref=15]Hesitant, as if in <b>fear</b> of his neighbors[/chref]); feel concern; feel interest; guardianship; maintenance ([chref=64]It is easy to <b>maintain</b> a situation while it is still secure[/chref]); precaution; safekeeping; tend to; upkeep; forethought (as in moment to moment); like; worry about (not hand wringing, but concern); wish (enough wish, want, desire to [chref=16]hold firmly to stillness[/chref]).<br>
<br>
<i>Care</i> and <i>fear</i> are related as we see in the synonym list above. Thus, [chref=53]were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, <b><i>fear</i></b> only paths that lead astray. The great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.[/chref] By paths? People? Who? Us! We don't care enough to mind our moment because we are caring about some future or past moment instead. I find <i>just</i> knowing this helps! Of course, knowing is easier than doing. And what is the doing? Nothing more than remembering what we know. Remembering [chref=28]returns[/chref] us, and we must <i>care</i> to remember.<br>
<br>
Finally, <a href="http://www.centertao.org/correlations.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">correlations pull care into a 'bigger picture'</a>,... well, maybe too big? Anyway, try them out.<br>

<b>NOTE:</b><br>
I had that reply above ready to post when Joe Frank came by and also had reservations about caring. The issue is so central to the 'big picture' that I see now, that I'll continue on and try to hone it down a bit more. Though can I do it justice? Perhaps I'm just beating around the bush. Oh well, here goes nothing...<br>
<br>
Fear comes in two flavors, adrenalin pumping autonomic and cognitive.  The later is the fear I'm referring to. This is the realm of care, concern, and worry listed above as synonyms of care. Invariably this all boils down to one thing - fear of loss. Paramount among the losses we suffer in life is death itself.  - either of a loved one or our 'self'. Death of  'self' is much more than actual physical death mind you. Loss of our 'stuff' or our social standing is a death of sorts. As Buddha pointed out in Truth <a href="/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, <a href="http://www.centertao.org/page.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url""> &quot;the illusion of self originates and manifests itself in a cleaving to things&quot;</a>.<br>
<br>
What do we fear losing in death? We don't regret losing the 'moment', but rather fret over the loss of an imagined future or a remembered past. Here in lies the irony: Life only lives 'now', yet we are either waiting for 'tomorrow' or lugging around 'yesterday'. The Tao Te Ching speaks to this in [chref=33]He who lives out his days has had a long life[/chref]. So essentially, <i>caring</i> about this day, this hour, this moment pulls you into eternity both literally and unavoidably.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, giving our awareness and caring concern over to imagined futures and remembered pasts leave us feeling disconnected  - dead to the present, so to speak. Understanding this is easy, but putting it into [chref=78]practice[/chref]? All the understanding in the world won't help. We must simply <i>care</i> enough about the quality of our moment to [chref=56]let our wheels move only along [that] old ruts[/chref]. When that is all that we <i>care</i> about, the external world takes <i>care</i> of itself,...<br>
<br>
[chref=57]I take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;<br>
I prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;<br>
I am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;<br>
I am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block. [/chref]<br>
<br>
So, in summary, I'd say that it is only when we fear losing the moment that we continually [chref=14]return[/chref] to it. It is fear, not need that pulls us there. Need pushes us forward into the future (i.e., future desires) or backward into past longings, 'good times' or regrets.<br>
<br>
Generally it is the visceral awareness - fear - of consequences that makes us care. For instance, you need only burn yourself once to <i>seriously care</i> about how you handle fire. Concern, at the visceral level, drives our behavior. I call this <a href="http://www.centertao.org/freewill.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">'pseudo free will'</a>, and it works. Our [chref=70]ignorance[/chref] is all that stands in the way. That, and not caring enough. It looks like we have to care enough in order to care enough. I suppose overcoming our ignorance is the key. And the key to that, in my experience, is experience -  [chref=51]circumstances bring [us] to maturity[/chref]. The 'answer' is really very easy, though we may not like it when we are in a hurry to get 'there'. Simply said, we must burn our fingers first, or as the good book puts it, [chref=36]If you would have a thing shrink, You must first stretch it[/chref]. We can't 'shrink it' until we 'stretch it' to the breaking point... ouch! Of course, we are always 'burning our fingers', but we don't care until we feel it so.<br>
