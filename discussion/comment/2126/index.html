                            I have to say this - I do not normally watch Trading Spouses, but your episode caught my attention the first time it played. The last half was re-run tonight and I thought I'd see if I could look you guys up.  After poking around this website, I am glad to see that it's not as bad as Fox portrayed it.  The pictures are great and I'm glad you've let the world in on your lives, both on Fox and this site. The boys seem like great kids, but it really did seem that they were a bit sheltered, but hopefully that has changed a little. I agree with a previous poster that your family does seem close-knit and there are some impressive bonds there. You don't see that much these days.  Thank you for posting a bit more about yourselves, I'm sure you had no choice b/c of the show though.  To Carl, I know you made a comment about being naive about it, but it's not just you guys that are naive about editting. Look at all the reality shows out there.....they're all editting in the same manner. They want ratings.  To both kids, you are both really adorable and seem like great people. Best wishes to you!                        </div>

                            I have watched the Trading Spouses episode twice and wanted to look for the &quot;real&quot; story online. That is how I came here.<br>
<br>
First, regardless of the truth of the episode, it certainly was captivating and certainly the best of the ones I have seen. Like other shows, I realized that the editing probably made the show vary quite a bit from reality.<br>
<br>
The Abbott family looked very well adjusted but certainly not &quot;conventional&quot; based upon many peoples standards. That does not make the family weird, just different.<br>
<br>
In America we have the tendancy of kicking kids out of the house while other cultures revere family and often have generations living under the same roof.<br>
<br>
I have seen firsthand how producers can and do edit to make a point. Years ago there was a major blizzard in Alaska. A network news crew had a camera set up inside a supermarket and I watched the live news feed as it happened. It would be edited later. As each person came into the store, they stomped snow off their shoes. When asked &quot;How bad is it out there?&quot;, almost everyone said &quot;Oh it's bad, but you should have been here last year&quot;.<br>
<br>
Finally, one guy came in and said &quot;This is the worst! I have never seen anything like this before&quot;. Turns out he had just moved from the lower 48 and thus had missed the previous years storm. When the news feed that night was shown, there he was coming in the door and saying &quot;This is the the worst!&quot; For him it was. For the TV Network news it made the point that it was really bad and at least one person said it was horrible.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that this episode was edited as heavily as it appears it had been. I think of the two families, yours was not treated as well as the other family. It made interesting watching and certainly brought about a dialog that would not have happened otherwise. Hopefully it will also allow more people to experience your music too. I'm glad that you have the abilty to set the record straight too. Good for you!                        </div>

                            I am curious, did you end up spending the money the way it was designated? I wonder if any of the families ever do.<br>
<br>
Also, maybe you can explain to me how it is that the families do NOT know ahead of time that they will be spending the other families money for them? Surely you have seen an episode of the show before participating in it.<br>
<br>
And to the boys, do you feel like your missing out on life because of your Father's beliefs? I'm just curious.                        </div>

Ok, but do we share that pure awareness with all creation... or is this awareness a special 'higher form' that is unique to humans, and perhaps whales, etc?<br>

                            I watched the show. I am 34 and still don't have a license. My mom was in the space that she felt that we had one car she couldn't afford to repair if she broke down. So I rode my bicycle around town.<br>
<br>
Since then, I have never really felt the need to get one.  I live on the east coast. And it's cheaper and better for the environment not to drive. Maybe the older son has his license. I just don't know why it's shocking for an 18 year old not to have one. Maybe that's just the case in California.<br>
<br>
We also used to live in such a small apartment that we had to double up. My 22 year old sister with my mom. I had to share a room with my mom too when I was a teenager. It's not a huge deal. Besides the cultural values stuff, I know from visiting Eastern Europe (and parts of America) that people also sleep together out of practicality and it's not that big of a deal. There are class issues involved here that people don't seem to get into, though I don't know if class was an issue in the Abbots case. In rural Maine, where I grew up, many families without money would have several family members in a bed. Having a huge house full of separated people is part of our economic privilege and not an inherently healthy thing. (tho it's not unhealthy either)                        </div>

Yes, that's the one.  I was being a little glib, a quality I retreat to when at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
&quot;To know but not to know that you know is best&quot; but I settle for &quot;I don't know and I think I know is not so good.&quot;  But, I must know I don't know or I couldn't have written that sentence.<br>

Welcome to the site. How does our name read... gunite john boy? It that gunite as related to concrete?<br>

<br>
Hallelujah! You sure have that right... on both counts. We've been impressed and gladdened by all the folks who see through the TV editors cut-switch-paste.   In the end, I think that how we interpret what we see, <i>and the emotion we put into that view</i>, simply mirrors who we are - our needs and fears.<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm on a <i>needs and fears</i> kick this month!  <img class="emoji" src="/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":lol:" alt=":lol:" height="20" />                        </div>

                            well actually it should read &quot;Goodnight John Boy&quot; an infamous line in the old television show, &quot;The Waltons&quot;.  Whether this be good or bad, People who watched the show tell me on a daily bases that I look like John Boy walton.  I used to hate hearing that but eventually I embraced it with a certain sence of humour. so much so that as a joke for a halloween party last year, all I did was put a mole on my face.  What was bitter sweet was that everyone got the joke without saying a word...even strangers.  What I think is odd is that the more I embrace it, the less I look like him.  To apease your current &quot;kick&quot;, I FEAR I will always resemble John Boy, and I NEED to grow a goatee or perhaps a bushy white beard like yours.  But then everyone will just say I look like you.                        </div>

                            I loved the Waltons.  I loved Earl Hamner's voice narrating at the beginning.  My family even said good night to each other like they did in the show...corny...but we are a corny, close family.  The DVD set is on my Christmas list.  Goodnight all!                        </div>

                            watched a lil netwok tv last night for the first time in months-and LO! an ad for the new season of TS! and what a sideshow-some screeching fat harpy with half her teeth throwing things out the door as the family sits stunned--if this show wasnt jerry springer inspired before, it is now. what an embarrasment-they could explore how different cultures get to know each other, and instead they highlight instablity and breakdowns...she makes Carl look hella normal, though...                        </div>

                            I was in an on-line discussion of how BMI is shaking down local jams for copyright fees and the Abbott's book of public domain songs was listed as a good alternative.<br>

Great! I just ordered it! Thanks!<br>
<br>
I was listening to the sound bites thinking the vocals sounded like that family on the TV show where they trade moms that we saw. (actually, we caught the bluegrass while channel surfing snd stopped cold  <img class="emoji" src="/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D" alt=":D" height="20" />  ) We thought it was a hoot.<br>
<br>
So I buy this song book and look into the authors, see the family pic and BOOM :shock: ! The TV show family.<br>
<br>
So I started doing a little research and WOW  did you get shafted, Abbotts. I'm sorry for that. You're good peeps! Cant ask for any more than close family ties. Bless you all.<br>

                            I was born and raised Catholic, in a small Iowa town.  I'd left my church years ago because of inconsistancies in teachings and my own confusion with my faith.<br>
Abbott Family, I want to thank you for having the courage to allow your lives and your faith to be shown to others.  As I watched I felt like questions were answered and confusion was lifted.  I have been learning of your faith, and think I've started finding the place I'm supposed to be in life.<br>
Thank you!                        </div>
