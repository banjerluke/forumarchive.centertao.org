                    Does anyone else out there have problems acting impulsively?  That is one of my main problems that has to be corrected. I get into situations where the thought(idea) turns into a word(s) into action so quickly that I regret later for what I did.  I reflect on my actions later, but I still tend to have this bad habit.  It is as if the mind immediately attaches to the thought before I can stop it, it winds up an action.  Any suggestions?  I know the solution is in the 12 steps we have been discussing, and in the Tao Te Ching.  Suggestions is still what I need.  Thank you.<br>

                            <span style="font-size:1.0em">Each week we address one chapter of the Tao Te Ching.  Chapter 63 was originally featured on the 4th week in March.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:1.0em"><i>Note:</i> The Tao Te Ching can be obscure, especially if you think you're supposed to understand what it's saying! We find it easier and more instructive to simply contemplate how the chapter resonates with your personal experience. Becoming more aware at this fundamental level simplifies life. This approach conforms to the view that true knowing lies within ourselves. Thus, when a passage in the scripture resonates, you've found your inner truth. The same applies for when it evokes a question; questions are the grist for self realization.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 63</b><br>
Do that which consists in taking no action;<br>
pursue that which is not meddlesome;<br>
savor that which has no flavor.<br>
<br>
Make the small big and the few many;<br>
do good to him who has done you an injury.<br>
<br>
Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;<br>
make something big by starting with it when small.<br>
<br>
Difficult things in the world must needs have their beginnings in the easy;<br>
big things must needs have their beginnings in the small.<br>
<br>
Therefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great<br>
that he succeeds in becoming great.<br>
<br>
One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;<br>
one who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.<br>
<br>
Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.<br>
That is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.                        </div>

                            this chapter seems to be advice on how to conduct yourself -<br>
and what good advice! deal with problems early and before they get the better of you, be good to others even if they do you wrong, be careful with your promises, and take problems seriously!<br>
there is more of course, but im too tired and hungry to think right now, so i'll be back later with reinforcements.                        </div>

                            This reminds me of my mother.  She was a very energetic and mercurial spirit; when she worked she used small quick movements.  She was quite the gardener and could do the work of a strong man, only she did it by taking small shovelsfull at a time.  In the end, she accomplished the same work as a strong man without taxing herself.<br>

I don't know if this is what this chapter is getting at, but I sure enjoyed that memory!                        </div>

                            This chapter tells it like it is. <i>Big things have their beginnings in the small,</i> for instance, can speak of how the infinitesimal 'big bang' moment evolved into the universe as it is today, or more personally, how I began as a new born babe and grew into a big ol' codger. Modeling this truth in life can be difficult when our mind's eye jumps ahead of itself and fails to perceive how nature proceeds. Our emotions buy into these false perceptions, our expectations rise - seldom matched by reality - and,  voila! ... we get angry. I find that it helps me greatly to distrust any and all perceptions that can be  [chref=1]named and/or spoken of[/chref]. Including this one (which only [chref=78]seems paradoxical [/chref]).<br>
<br>
<i>Savor that which has no flavor</i>, is a beautiful invitation to step beyond instinct, if even for a moment or two. Of course, <i>that which has no flavor</i> is boring, which is why some years ago we came up with our Taoist motto...&quot;be bored again&quot;. It is the deep subtle side of consciousness that we are invited to <i>savor</i>. It is a little ironic that all the 'spiritual' pep talk that we engage in has a  certain elitist <i>flavor</i> to it. A 'spiritual' path, we are promised, is [chref=19]something [/chref] special, yet in fact, it is less than [chref=67]nothing[/chref].<br>
<br>
<i>Do good to him who has done you an injury</i> certainly has a Christian ring to it. The best I can do in this regard is realize that<i> he who has done me an injury</i> has no free will (just like me) and so is utterly helpless (just like me); whose actions reflect their inner harmony, or lack of same, (just like me). Knowing that we are all in the same boat helps me avoid taking too many pot shots at others. Of course, I've not always had such a forgiving perspective. All I can say is that as I become more inwardly secure, I become kinder... though I don't have any say-so in the matter. I suppose that is why there is so much hypocrisy in human affairs; we put on a 'moral' face to the world to appear that we are more like who we wish we were (or who others expect us to be). There is irony here as well; give up who you wish to be and you are more likely to be happy just being. If you are happy  <img class="emoji" src="/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D" alt=":D" height="20" />  just being, then you will be more inwardly secure and thus more likely to <i>Do good to him who has done you an injury</i> .<br>
<br>
<i>Do that which consists in taking no action</i> comes down to approaching life in bite size 'chunks', moment to moment, keeping as close to the simple, <i>small and easy</i> as possible and letting the rest take care of itself. Living at this pace, I [chref=37]never act, yet nothing is left undone[/chref]. I am likewise relieved of the responsibility for my actions. Whew! It is odd when I think about it, allowing ALL <i>action</i> to flow in each <i>small and easy</i> moment frees me from <i>action</i>. Reality is irony.                        </div>

                            It?s sinking in more how I have to work in small amounts, on a regular basis, for the long-term benefits I seek ? mainly, contentment. For example, I can really see that being mindful, being present in the moment, as often as possible, really helps me be more content. To have more of this, I need to put forth the effort on a regular basis. For me, it?s easy to give up making any effort, if I think in terms of a big ?goal?, say of being 100% content (which of course won?t ever happen). But if I?m at least putting in a few minutes daily for mindful yoga, and mindful meditation, then I?ve at least gotten a little farther along. By starting small, I steadily build mindfulness, and I don?t get so discouraged.<br>
<br>
Savour that which has no flavour is one of my favorite ideas. These days, when I?m experiencing something pleasant, if I?m attentive enough to think beyond the immediate desire, I find myself being suspicious of the good feeling. It?s like it?s a beacon, reminding me to pay attention to what?s really important. To really see reality, and not be caught up in whatever illusion the particular desire promises to fulfill. I even find this in meditation, when I?m feeling ?blissful? ? it?s too easy to think I?m doing good in my meditation, rather than remembering that there will always be more struggles & suffering that I?ll have to work with. Also, no flavour ties in with my experience of mindfulness ? when I?m truly mindful in the moment, there is no flavour, no pleasantness or unpleasantness. There is just reality, without judgment or clinging, which is what ends up leading to problems.<br>
<br>
Considering things easy and meeting with difficulties certainly happens to me a lot. And sometimes it seems like society?s norm is to be on the go, always doing things, at a fast pace that demands decisions be made lightly, without serious deliberation. Following desires in our lives, has the illusion of easy, but it leads to difficulties. Following the constant, the way, can feel difficult at times, but it leads to the ?ease? of true contentment.                        </div>
