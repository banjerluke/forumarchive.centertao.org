<br>
Speaking for myself, I've been conditioned to act as if I know.  In school, if you don't know, you 'fail.'  At my job I was not allowed to say I didn't know.  I'm like a broken record, but below that conditioning is fear.  Fear that I will be thrown out of the tribe, the job, school, if they find out I don't know, and then I will end up in the gutter and die!<br>
<br>
I remember at work there was a Korean programmer, and whenever some crisis was brought to him, he would say &quot;I know nothing.&quot;  Pretty soon he had all the programmers saying that (jokingly, of course) and what a burden was lifted just by those words, even in jest.<br>
<br>
So, I know nothing.  It took me over 50 years to get here and it's pretty nice.                </div>

                            <span style="font-size:1.0em">Each week we address one chapter of the Tao Te Ching.  Chapter 55 was originally featured on the 5th week in January.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:1.0em"><i>Note:</i> The Tao Te Ching can be obscure, especially if you think you're supposed to understand what it's saying! We find it easier and more instructive to simply contemplate how the chapter resonates with your personal experience. Becoming more aware at this fundamental level simplifies life. This approach conforms to the view that true knowing lies within ourselves. Thus, when a passage in the scripture resonates, you've found your inner truth. The same applies for when it evokes a question; questions are the grist for self realization.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 55</b><br>
One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe:<br>
Poisonous insects will not sting it;<br>
Ferocious animals will not pounce on it;<br>
Predatory birds will not swoop down on it.<br>
Its bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm.<br>
It does not know of the union of male and female yet its male member will stir:<br>
This is because its virility is at its height.<br>
It howls all day yet does not become hoarse:<br>
This is because its harmony is at its height.<br>
<br>
To know harmony is called the constant;<br>
To know the constant is called discernment.<br>
To try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;<br>
For the mind to egg on the breath is called violent.<br>
<br>
A creature in its prime doing harm to the old<br>
Is known as going against the way.<br>
That which goes against the way will come to an early end.                        </div>

                            The 'Jesus walked on water' interpretation of this would be that <i>ferocious animals <b>will not pounce</b> on a new born babe. </i>The belief being that <i>one who possesses virtue in abundance</i> <b>will be invincible</b>... <b>objectively speaking!</b> In one way or another, we all seek such security: we buy insurance, take vitamin pills or <i>vitality</i> enhancing potions, wear nice clothes, and... well the list is endless. The ultimate example of such self-salvation is found in humanity's 'spiritual paths'. Here, only the 'born-again' go to heaven. The 'born-again' interpretation of this chapter could be 'only the <i>virtuous</i> Taoist are saved'.<br>

I prefer to interpret this chapter from a <b>subjective</b> point of view. Seen this way, the issue is not how to secure the self. Rather, the issue is the subjective 'self' that feels the need for security in the first place. After all, <i>a new born babe</i> has not yet formed an idea of self. Once we believe in a separate self, we launch our self into a life long quest to save 'it' (<i>add</i> to 'it', secure and protect 'it', show 'it' off, and so forth).<br>
<br>
<i>The breath</i> corresponds to our original <i>new born</i> nature. The <i>mind</i> corresponds to what we learn subsequently. First, we learn the '<b>illusion of self*</b>'. Next, we learn a world-view to which we can cling in order to bolster that 'illusion of self'. Once the <i>mind</i> establishes it-self, it imagines possibilities and <i>eggs on the breath</i> to achieve them, and then hangs on to them for dear life. We forget our <i>new born babe, </i>rush on [chref=52] to know the child[/chref], and eagerly [chref=36]strengthens[/chref] its notions of self. The fact that we set up the self is part of our humanity, but we can only find true <i>harmony</i>   when our 'illusion of self' is [chref=36]laid aside[/chref] enough to know the <i>new born babe</i> again.<br>

                            I think similar to Carl, about the interpretation of the ?invulnerability? of the newborn babe. This is before we develop speech and complex thinking. We add to our woes as we have more mental interpretations of what happens to us. When a newborn cries because it feels hungry, and stops when it?s being fed, it?s without thinking about its ?suffering?, without the shoulds, the expectations we develop as we grow up. Without all the mental chaos added on, there is a basic harmony.<br>
<br>
The more I?m able to live my life without all my interpretations & illusions, instead seeing things clearly, realistically, the more harmony there is. I?m able to know the constant, which for me is seeing things as they truly are, instead of filtered through the illusions of my desires. My main ?effort? in life these days is not to push and strive to make certain things happen, but rather to put forth effort to pay attention to what?s real in life. Using the ?weight of the uncarved block? to push down on desires, ?turning back? from desires to the harmony of the constant.<br>
<br>
When I first started reading the Tao Te Ching, I thought of ?a creature in its prime doing harm to the old?, as young people, (including myself), not being respectful to older people, the ways of tradition, etc. Now I think of the old as the way, the constant (old as in eternity). Fighting against the way life really is, through desires or by-paths, ends in problems for any of us.                        </div>

                            Thinking about new borns crying for their needs, makes me realize even more the futility of spoken words. Why do we teach a child to talk? In order to communicate with it and get what <i>we</i> want from it easier. A child instinctively knows how to get what it wants without speech. If only we'd stay quiet more in our everyday life-at my most serene, i'm very quiet, but I know so many who feel the need to fill up every second with noise and speech. My kid's mother is like that-chatter chatter, at movies, concerts...she could be looking at the grand canyon and she'd be rambling on about the Macgyver episode from last night...oh well, pull myself up a little at a time and hope some others come along for the ride...                        </div>

                            Being a kind of quiet person, my first inclination was to think of language as the enemy, but it's not.  Carl pointed out that the value of language is social interaction-- dogs sniff butts and we speak to one another.  It's just that we have to remember that words attempt to describe reality but they are not reality.  We have to remember that words are just &quot;a finger pointing towards the moon&quot;  and that in many ways they limit our perception.  At least, that's what I lately learned from my friend Carl.<br>

And thanks Joe for your concise and simple description of what the struggle is for all of us.  We are complicated creatures trying to live life simply.                        </div>

                            What is this message board if not social interaction, AKA chit chat?  Seems to me to be instinctive to seek the company of our fellows--don't you think so Buddy?

                            Ay, theres the rub. I seek solitude, yet desire company and the support of others.  probably a pretty common scenario. I don't actively avoid those who are around me, but i try not to get pulled into a converstaion when I don't have to. I hate idle chatter 'hows the weather' etc...I want every interaction to reveal something about the person i'm talking to, and to reveal something about me to them.<br>
But I don't want to be seen as stuck up. Conversely, I don't want to be seen as common, either. Don't want ot be taken for granted, my being or my words. Really the break I took from these boards did me a favor, but it's also good to be back. Man is a social animal by instinct for sure, but it's nice to have deserts to wandre off into once in a while...                        </div>

I have found some comfort in this phase:  &quot;What other people think of me is none of my business.&quot;  I will certainly always care what people think of me, but I have little control over it.  I have learned that what others think of me is mostly based on their stuff, their projections of what's going on inside of them.  I have also learned that when I am wondering what people are thinking of me, they're not thinking of me! They're wondering what others are thinking of them!  I am not the center of anyone's universe but my own.<br>

Of course, I have to be reminded of this over and over.  In fact, just writing this helped with some tapes that were playing in my head this morning.  So thanks, Buddy!                        </div>
