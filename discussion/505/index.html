                    I remember as a kid following the pack because I was told to believe that it would lead me to eternal salvation with Jesus. But eventually, I became very skeptical of that view... not necessarily because I thought it was wrong, it just didn't mesh with my view anymore. I didn't agree. But even then, I was never part of the &quot;normal&quot; crowd.<br>
<br>
Rather than ever really following the &quot;normal&quot; crowd, I almost wound up the opposite. There was a point in my high school mini-rebellious phase that I decided I was going to be the opposite of ANYTHING normal. At the time I didn't realize that what I was doing was just joining another crowd... the opposite crowd... but a crowd nonetheless... a following.<br>
<br>
I thought about it first when I asked one of my friends why he did a particular thing (I don't remember what). His response was &quot;because none of the preppies do it.&quot; So, we too were a 'clique' ... a body of followers following something... it just happened to be something else. I thought it was kind of silly to base my actions around doing things differently just for the sake of doing them to be different... especially when the &quot;preppies&quot; started adopting bits of their fashion sense from the &quot;outcasts&quot; style. Then what were the outcasts to do in order to maintain extreme polarity?<br>
<br>
I decided that it was all the same. I decided I needed to do/wear/think what I wanted to; what felt right for me... regardless of what 'clique' it fell into. It was this attitude that actually got me more friends and a start towards more understanding of others, and a more tolerant view of the world around me. So by not &quot;fitting in&quot; with anyone, I kind of fit in with everyone... yet no one... in some way... or something. I think there must be a Tao Te Ching verse or Tao view that could put that idea into better words.<br>
<br>
I guess your sentence on the egoism of being an oddball is what made me start thinking about this. When I was pretending to be more of an &quot;oddball&quot; or &quot;outcast&quot; than I was, I was proud of it... but only because it got me the attention (sometimes negative) and the judgement I was kind of asking for. But a lot of it wasn't really me. It was that intentional opposite thing that everyone else in my group was doing. Rebel follwers I guess we were. But pretending to like the metal band Slipknot because they are soooooo dark, when in fact I had never even heard them at the time... that I was not proud of... turns out I don't like their music. Soon I felt like a hypocrite. But then, I became my true oddball... my inner oddball has been revealed, and I am happy with that. I no longer rub in in people's faces that &quot;Hey! I'm different! Crazy!&quot; like I used to when I was posing as a semi-punk goth troubled teen kid. But it's more like &quot;Oh, you didn't know? I am different.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Mr. Rogers an all those cheesy kid-show hosts I grew up with turned out to be right! I just needed to be me!                </div>

                            [chref=64]Deal with a thing while it is still nothing[/chref] sounds easy enough. Or does it? When I encounter folks lamenting how they get side tracked off yoga, I suggest they <i>do just one posture a day conscientiously!</i> Simply doing those few minutes of yoga would permit their  'yoga dream' to [chref=17]happen naturally.[/chref] Does this really work; do they do it?<br>
<br>
Yes, just as [chref=64]a tree that can fill the span of a man's arms grows from a downy tip,[/chref] one posture a day will grow to span one's life. But, I have met few (or any?) who have succeeded in following this easy path. An '<i>all or nothing</i>' desire seems to drive our lives instead. Perhaps this is why simple things are [chref=70]very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice[/chref].<br>
<br>
This '<i>all or nothing</i>' desire plays a role in everything we do. It is fascinating to behold the [chref=71]difficulty[/chref] we have with this, given our delusional <a href="http://www.centertao.org/freewill.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">belief in free will</a> :roll:. Clearly [chref=46] having too many desires[/chref]  is the enemy of 'free will'. Of course, [chref=1]having desires[/chref] is also the 'energy' source for life's activity. And what is 'too many'? Desire: too have or not to have?<br>
<br>
Typically we want to have it both ways: The pleasures which following our desires promises, yet the tranquility which comes from having [chref=19]as few desires as possible[/chref]. Naturally, having it both ways is impossible, so '<i>all or nothing</i>' appears to be the alternative we often 'choose'. Surely, the only other option is to savor the moment as it passes [chref=64]from beneath our feet[/chref]. Then, it is easy to [chref=64]deal with situations before symptoms develop[/chref],... step by easy step. Who knows, perhaps we can even [chref=37]cease to desire and remain still[/chref] now and then.                        </div>

<div class="QuoteText">And what is 'too many'?</div>

<br>
That really varies from person to person.  Too many for you may be not enough for someone else.   I have a friend who wants to go and do everything.  She complained to me that she's too busy so I asked her why does she say yes to all these things and she answered &quot;because I want to do all of them!&quot;  So there you go!  Come to think of it, my whole family is a bunch of contented homebodies, so maybe it's just a combination of nature and nurture that determines how many is too many.<br>
<br>
Too many for what?  Well, just enough to be lively but not suffer all that much. :roll:<br>
<br>
To deal with a thing while is it still nothing is such good advice, like a stitch in time saves nine, something I never do.  Well, not never.  I can remember one situation where Sidney our border collie chased my car down the driveway to Jamestown Road.  He did that once.  After that, whenever I was leaving I made sure he was confined to the house so that he didn't develop the habit.  I dealt with it while it was still nothing only because his life was at risk and I am responsible for his safety.  It was a wise thing to do.<br>
<br>
Don't you think that, besides our natural tendency not to deal with things while they're nothing, that the hardest part is recognizing the need?  It takes a lot of wisdom to see that something that is still nothing needs to be dealt with.  I'm thinking of human relationships or even foreign policy...it takes a whole lot of sensitivity to perceive a need before it becomes apparent.  Sensitivity or maybe psychic powers!                        </div>

You bet! There in lies the advantage of age. It takes years and years to stumble our way through life's circumstances, and in our stumbling we learn, gain in<br>
[chref=51]maturity[/chref], and wisdom deepens. So, I suppose wisdom is just another word for perspective - seeing the forest in spite of the trees (i.e., [chref=56] mysterious sameness[/chref]). When all we see in life are the 'trees', we keep bumping into them,... or cutting them down. :roll:                        </div>
