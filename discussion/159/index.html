                            <span style="font-size:1.0em">Each week we address one chapter of the Tao Te Ching.  Chapter 57 was originally featured on the 2nd week in February.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:1.0em"><i>Note:</i> The Tao Te Ching can be obscure, especially if you think you're supposed to understand what it's saying! We find it easier and more instructive to simply contemplate how the chapter resonates with your personal experience. Becoming more aware at this fundamental level simplifies life. This approach conforms to the view that true knowing lies within ourselves. Thus, when a passage in the scripture resonates, you've found your inner truth. The same applies for when it evokes a question; questions are the grist for self realization.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter 57</b><br>
Govern the state by being straightforward; wage war by being crafty;<br>
but win the empire by not being meddlesome.<br>
<br>
How do I know that it is like that? By means of this.<br>
<br>
The more taboos there are in the empire<br>
The poorer the people;<br>
The more sharpened tools the people have<br>
The more benighted the state;<br>
The more skills the people have<br>
The further novelties multiply;<br>
The better known the laws and edicts<br>
The more thieves and robbers there are.<br>
<br>
Hence the sage says,<br>
I take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;<br>
I prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;<br>
I am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;<br>
I am free from desire and the people of themsleves<br>
become simple like the uncarved block.                        </div>

                            Well, I see where I get some of my jaundiced view of civilization. In fact, though, it is not <i>&quot;By means of this...&quot;, </i>that I see it so.  One of the final comments attributed to Buddha was about <b>not</b> 'buying' anything unless and until you verify it with your own careful observation. But, how do I know when I know? When I [chref=71]know[/chref] I don't... I do.  <img class="emoji" src="/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)" alt=":)" height="20" /> Anyway....<br>
<br>
<i>The more skills the people have, the further novelties multiply</i>, is obvious, but what is less obvious is how this is a problem. After all, <i>novelties</i> and variety make the world go round, eh? However, closer observation reveals the unintended consequences of <i> skills and novelites. </i> Here's the twist ? our [chref=18]cleverness[/chref] gives us a survival edge, but that edge also cuts us loose from nature's balancing influences.<br>

<i>Taboos</i>, are proscriptions <b>against</b> or <b>pro</b> something. On the pro side are a culture's initiation rites. Our's, whether it's going off to college or circumcision robs us of something deeper (mystery), even as it gives us a sense (albeit fleeting) of security. Is the trade off worth it, or do we end up <i>poorer</i>. Ah, you say, but college make us richer! Poverty of spirit is so much more impoverishing than poverty of materials. Furthermore, it's not going to college that is at issue, it is the 'positive' taboo, i.e., the idea you are diminished by not going, just as you are diminished by not being circumcised, or,  well... you name it.<br>
<br>
<i>The better known the laws and edicts</i>... may sound like <i>laws and edicts</i> cause <i>thieves and robbers</i>. I find it simpler to see <i>laws and edicts</i> as simply symptomatic of <i>thieves and robbers</i>. So, what causes the <i>thieves and robbers</i>? How much <i>robbery</i> occurs within close knit families /tribes? <i> Thieves and robbers</i> are just one the unintended consequences of civilization?s inability to connect people as intimately as our hunter-gatherer ancestors were. I can't think of a social ill that doesn't stem from this post agricultural revolution [chref=51]circumstance [/chref]. And yet the 'party line' exalts civilization as the cure for our 'beastly' nature. It's so fascinating how we bamboozle ourselves.<br>
<br>
Now, the only relief from this goofy situation lies at the end of this chapter. I've found that <i>simple</i> is directly proportional to <i>desire</i>. What about those ironic occasions when I really <i>desired</i> to <i>simplify</i> my life and so threw out stuff? Naturally, that works about as well as putting out a fire with gasoline. <i>Take no action, prefer stillness, not meddlesome</i> all allow life to unfold naturally. It is my [chref=64] desire[/chref] to have <b>my way</b> with nature that complicates life. It is my <i>desire</i> that disrupts the perfection of the moment.  [chref=1]Desires[/chref] are insidious. You can't live with 'em, and you can't live without 'em! The best I can do is carefully observe, moment to moment, in order to notice when my <i>desire</i> may be standing in the way of nature's way. That often gives me enough motivation, (counterbalancing desire) to remain <i>still</i> and <i>free</i>. Yes, truly  <i>free</i>                        </div>

                            The most puzzling one to me is the more taboos the poorer the people.  The two things don't seem related.  The only way I could make any sense of it is that perhaps people are enriched by following the natural way, but if people are afraid that their natural instincts are forbidden, they cannot be so enriched. ????<br>

The last verse says if you don't stir the pot, everything will follow its natural course.  It sounds like the Buddha.                        </div>

                            the taboo part struck me too, but i see how it relates to modern life.

-as free speech and freedoms are being curtailed, we're poorer for it.

I get your meaning, but in my experience opinions just cloud my inner self and keep me from clarity.  Opinions/free speech are just one more thing to cling to, one more desire to cause suffering.  Letting go of that will bring peace.  Focusing on 'the way' or what's really important to me brings peace, diminishes suffering.<br>
<br>
Of course, expressing opinions is fun and we love to feel smarter than and 'edgy' but the price is high.  I spar with my husband all the time, but always within is a place of peace and that's what enriches me.<br>
<br>
I hope it doesn't seem like I'm always disagreeing with you; it just helps me to solidify stuff by writing it down.  It's my own experience I'm talking about and has little to do with right or wrong.                        </div>

                            Winning the empire by not being meddlesome, speaks to me of letting go. Everything in nature, even mankind and civilization, will work the way it works. No matter how much I meddle, try to control things, things still work according to the ?big picture?, not my narrow-lensed snapshot. This to me is why it?s hard to think that I have any free will.<br>
<br>
Taboos reflect other chapters about blunting the sharpness, softening the glare. Taboos are a hardness, a set-in-stone this is the way things should be. (Similar to sharpness, or glare.) To me this creates differences ? us/right, them/wrong. There?s no room for compassion, for acceptance. This black and white perspective moves away from appreciating the ?mysterious sameness? of people, of the universe.<br>
<br>
Sharpened tools, and skills, reflect verses about knowing and speaking. They?re all ways to differentiate, to make me ?better? because I ?know? the answer, or because I have the tools or skills, I can do the job the ?right? way. Which misses the point, because we?re all doing the best we can, and we?re all ?failing? at being perfect, in one way or another.                        </div>

                            Carl,<br>
<br>
As an educator (high school teacher), I am confused with you calling college an &quot;initiation&quot; rite.  Futhermore, I would never diminish my students who did not go to college.  However, I do encourage all high school graduates to have some sort of post-secondary education whether it be a two year or four year degree.<br>
<br>
Being trained in a job and out in the job force is the very backbone of our economy whether it's a dental technician, electrician, heart specialist, dentist, pharmacist, or a chinese restaurant owner, or Radio Shack employee.  You don't need &quot;material&quot; goods you say.  You still need a place to sleep, food to eat, clothes to wear (okay, so maybe you don't Buddy!)<br>
<br>
We all need some sort of &quot;job&quot; to earn a living.  It's the unskilled labor force that is destined to live in poverty Carl.  They are called the &quot;working poor&quot;.<br>
It's a proven fact the more education you have, the higher your standard of living.<br>
<br>
I don't know what the economy is like in Santa Cruz, but here in Michigan it's awful!  Factories are down-sizing or closing because they've been &quot;outsourced&quot; by foreign labor.  Do any of you buy Kellogg's cereals?  Well, Battle Creek, Michigan was Kellogg's headquarters...not any more.  It's somewhere overseas.  People all around Battle Creek lost jobs.  And that's happening to cities all over Michigan.  It used to be back in the 50's and even the 60's and 70's, men would come to Flint or Detroit Michigan to get a job in one of the auto factories...not anymore.  Factories are closing.<br>
<br>
Post secondary education after high school is not something to do...if the &quot;spirit moves you&quot;, it is a must to stay afloat....it is a must if you want to be able to afford rent, a house, a car, gas to put in the car, insurance for the car....let alone health, dental and optical insurance for yourself!!<br>
<br>
And, I'm sure those students that Buddy looks after are receiving counseling in job training.  I don't think the state of Oregon would call it an initiation rite.  A job is what is going to keep them out of poverty, out of crime and out of jail.  It's not enough to just have a high school diploma now days, you must have some training beyond high school in order to &quot;make it&quot; in the job force.<br>
<br>
The lecture's over...school's out.<br>

As an educator (high school teacher), I am confused with you calling college an &quot;initiation&quot; rite.  Futhermore, I would never diminish my students who did not go to college.</div>
</blockquote>
<br>
I understand what you're saying. I also realized you may have a hard time understanding me.  When a person believes his cultural paradigm IS reality, it is impossible for him to see it any other way. Also, there is the 'if your not with us, you are against us' dynamic. Any challenge to a paradigm's rites always feel threatening to the 'paradigm's patriots'.  I'm NOT suggesting that people not go to college. In fact, I would hope that the doctor that operates on me has :!:<br>
<br>
Seeing how out of whack some American cultural taboos actually are vis-a-vis <b>healthy ancestral human needs</b> probably requires either living outside the comfort zone of one's own cultural paradigm long enough, or living long enough to see the 'taboos' for what they are, i.e., a taboo feels differently to those who <a href="http://www.centertao.org/belief.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">believe</a> in it than to those who don't.<br>
<br>
Our 'poverty' as a culture is profoundly spiritual, social and emotional, and is only getting worse. Of course, to change this would require calling into question all the 'taboos' our country has <a href="http://www.centertao.org/belief.php" rel="nofollow" class="bbcode_url"">believed</a> in for several centuries. Not a welcome proposition and so things will need to get much worse before the 'drunk' hits bottom and is ready to return to sanity. Well, we can hope anyway....<br>
<br>
Again, my comments on this chapter are not about whether kids get trained for the work force or not. I'd say to anyone, follow your heart, do what you need to do, and do it with as much care as you can muster. That you need to strongly defend college, jobs, standard of living, and so on, reflects something you may be struggling with in your personal life. I wish you well with that.<br>
<br>
I hope I'm not offending you with these comments. I tend to just call 'em as I see 'em which does piss off a lot of folks. A good Taoist would keep his mouth shut, which shows you how uncouth I am.

                            How interesting that michigander should make a comment so appropriate to what i'm dealing with right now at work: the juvenile offenders here are now taking 'work experience' as part of their daily school schedule. Sounds good in theory-reality is it consists of them washing dishes 10 hours a day (because state is too cheap to hire real staff) instead of attending regular classes.<br>
I have nothing against kids working, no job is below me or anyone, but these are youths who can barely read or write, have no sense of history or socioligy or math skills,,,and they're being pulled out of class 3 days a week and stuck in a dishroom. This bothers me greatly, and I've even been in contact with a state congresswoman about it. The way things are going, dishwashing may be the only job an average American worker can get, no matter what their education...<br>
So in this case, job training isnt going to do them much good-a house built without a foundation, as it were-or in this case a shotgun shack...<br>
-though this school we have here probably doesnt do them much good either, but thats another story-anyway I tell them the best education is the one we give ourselves...                        </div>

                            You didn't offend me Carl.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.  I don't pretend to know anything about the philosophy/religion of Taoism.  Heck, I once wore a perfume named Tabu, so that shows how completely &quot;UnTao&quot; I am!<br>
<br>
I'm not &quot;struggling&quot; with anything in my personal life Carl.  I feel so blessed to have a job that I love to do. If I could live my life over, I don't think I'd change a thing (except some hairstyles!). I wanted to be a teacher since I was in elementary school.  It's like my dream has come true.<br>
<br>
And I live a dreamy life. I came from a good, wholesome home (like your home) with two loving parents (like your boys have).  That's what we have in common.<br>
<br>
Of course I'm going to defend college, jobs and not lowering one's standard of living and rising to one's potential.  That's what I believe in and that's what I teach.<br>
<br>
Yes, education was stressed in our home (my father being a teacher no doubt had a lot to do with it), but spirituality was also stressed in our home.<br>
Although I was raised a Protestant, I wasn't raised to believe that &quot;our&quot; religion was the &quot;only&quot; way.<br>
<br>
And emotional security was a biggie too.  We spent a lot of time together as a family and still do.  There was no social void either.  My house was where all the neighborhood kids gathered.  I still keep in contact with my oldest friends from 5th grade. I don't feel this &quot;poverty&quot; you talk about.  I feel enriched.<br>
<br>
My grass is green on this side of the fence...well actually it's snow-covered!<br>

Actually, I don't think we are disagreeing. It is more like we are talking past each other. We are talking about different things which just happen to use the same words. You might say we are looking out of different windows describing what we see and <i>feel</i>. It sounds like we are talking about the same thing because language is so linear and limited when we try to use it to communicate visceral matters. :?  This happens an awful lot between people I notice, <i>even</i> those who share the same cultural paradigm. Of course, such misunderstandings make the world go round.<br>
<br>
That we are considering each others 'reflections' speaks to something deeper we share beyond our Tao / &quot;UnTao&quot; circumstance. Great!<br>
